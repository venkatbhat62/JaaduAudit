# connectivity test spec 
# Author: havembha@gmail.com,  2022-12-10
# Format
# <environment>: like Dev, Test, UAT, Prod... or All -  free form text
#   HostName: hostname in regular expression format. when current hostname match to this name, specification in section
#            override the spec in 'All' environment section
#   Variable: typically used to derive local site partial name to formulate local site hostnames for local components
#            can also be used to define hostnames per environment under each environment section and have
#             service definition under 'All' to optimize the definitions
#     <variableName>:  command to be executed and output to be assigned this variable. Output can result in string or number
#               this names needs to be unique within a section. If the same name is present in 'All' also, 
#                values specified under environment section takes precedence
#   Items:
#     <serviceName> - unique name identifying the service
#       Command: run command to gather currnet state of the process like "ps -ef|grep <processName>" in Linux or
#             get-process -name <processName> in windows
#             to check whether a process is running before doing connection check to listen port on local host
#           Optional parameters, default None
#       Condition: '(>|<|=)(space)(<number> or <string>)' 
#          If the output of above command results in multiple lines, count of lines is compared to the condition number.
#          If the output is single line and it is integer,
#              the output is converted to integer and compared with integer number specified in condition
#          Else output string is compared to the condition string.
#                This is useful to match the result of command like true, false, pass, fail etc to determin next step
#           Optional parameters, default None
#       HostNames: destination hostname in short form or in FQDN form, can be IP address also. Can be single or in CSV format
#         destination hostname can be localhost, in which case the connectivity to local port is verified. 
#         This is be useful to check the local process listening in on expected LISTEN port
#         If more then one hostname is specified via CSV, connectivity check is performed for to all those hosts
#           for each of the ports specified under Ports.
#         can use variable names like {{var1}} or {{var2}}<partialName>,{{var2}}<partialName>
#             value of variable will be substitued to form full hostname
#       Ports: single port or ports in CSV format, or port range like startingPort-(dash)-endingPort
#          if more than one port is specified or range is specified, connectivity is checked to all those ports
#            from current host to destination host
#       Protocol: TCP|UDP
#         If UDP, it will send UDP packets, so that one can check the receipt of packets on other end manually or using other tools
#           UDP does not provide any conclusive test results
#         Optional parameter, defaults to TCP
#
Dev:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: (LAPTOP-QOCNVF0T)
  Variable:
    ### these definitions override the definitions under 'All' section
    ### in DEV environment, connect to one remote host, in test environment, connect to diff host
    Var1: echo "microsoft.com"
    ### take local site name using current hostname, use to derive other host names with that prefix later
    ### separated the length with space so that first part of the command matach to the allowed command for windows
    Var2: (hostname).substring( 0,5)
    ### dummy example to show use of multiple variables in single HostNames
    Var3: echo "-QOCNVF0T"

#
# Keep definition for 'All' environment at the end.
# this is to ensure, Dev, Test, UAT, Prod etc environment specific values are seen/read first and 
# assigned to variables. If a variable is not yet defined under Dev, Test.. like environment,
# and that variable is defined under 'All', value under 'All' will be picked up
# if variable is already defined under environment before, value under 'All' will be ignored.
