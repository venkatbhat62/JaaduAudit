#            If the reference file is binary type, MD5 checksum is stored with this name
#            If the operatoin is compare, object saved before will be compared with current value.
#        Command: - If the operation is save, gather environment details using this command and save the content with <ObjectName>

#            Only commands listed in JAAllowedCommands.yml are allowed. 
#            On windows, these commands are executed via powershell, whose base path is defined in environment spec file
#               via the parameter 'CommandPowershell'
#            For a given object name, either Command or FileNames can be specified, NOT both.
#        CompareType: optional - Checksum, checksum, Text or text 
#             Specify Checksum to compare binary files or any files where text comparison is not needed.
#             If not specified, 
#                On Unix/Linux hosts, it uses 'file' command to determin the file type.
#                On Windows, file type defined in environment spec file via the parameter 'BinaryFileTypes' is used
#                For binary files, defaults to Checksum
#                For ASCII text, defaults to Text       
#        Environment: optional - match to one of the environment defined in JAEnvironment.yml file
#            if the current hostname match to the environment spec, this ObjectName will be saved or compared.
#            Default - All environment
#        FileNames: file names in CSV form or find command that returns file names in multiple lines
#            each file name is suffixed with NameSuffix.
#            If operation is save, save the contents of the files with <fileName>.<ObjectName> without the path name.
#            If operation is compare, current file is compared to saved file.
#            For a given object name, either Command or FileNames can be specified, NOT both.
#            On Linux/Unix host, if the first word is 'find', it will execute the comamnd and work all files names
#               returned in the command response
#            On Windows host, if the first word is 'get-childitem', it will execute the comamnd and work all files names
#               returned in the command response
#        SkipH2H: optional - Yes, YES, NO or No 
#            Skip this file from upload/download actions, keep the file on local host only.
#            Suggest to use this option to keep any sensitive information on local host only, not to upload to SCM.
#            Also, use this when the object or file is application to this host only like certificate        
#            Default - No
