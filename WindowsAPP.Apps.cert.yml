#             to check whether a process is running before connecting to get the cert in use and decode it
#           Optional parameters, default None
#   Condition: <number> or <string> - 
#          If the output of above command results in multiple lines, count of lines is compared to the condition number.
#          If the output is single line and it is integer,
#              the output is converted to integer and compared with integer number specified in condition
#          Else output string is compared to the condition string.
#                This is useful to match the result of command like true, false, pass, fail etc to determin next step

#   FileName: Certificate file name including path
#   PatternDate:  
#   PatternAlias: Expected alias name(s), if not present, declare cert error

  HostName: (LAPTOP-QOCNVF0T)
  Certs:
    ### these definitions override the definitions under 'All' section
    Apache:
      Command: get-nettcpconnection -localport 6000
      Condition: 6
Test:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: ((...)(t)(...)([0-9][0-9]))
UAT:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: ((...)(u)(...)([0-9][0-9]))
Prod:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: ((...)(p)(...)([0-9][0-9]))
#
# Keep definition for 'All' environment at the end.
# this is to ensure, Dev, Test, UAT, Prod etc environment specific values are seen/read first and 
# assigned to variables. If a variable is not yet defined under Dev, Test.. like environment,
# and that variable is defined under 'All', value under 'All' will be picked up
# if variable is already defined under environment before, value under 'All' will be ignored.
