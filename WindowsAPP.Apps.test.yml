# test spec
# Author: havembha@gmail.com,  2022-12-25
# Format
# <environment>: like Dev, Test, UAT, Prod... or All -  free form text
#   HostName: hostname in regular expression format. when current hostname match to this name, specification in section
#            override the spec in 'All' environment section
#   Variable: typically used to derive local site partial name to formulate local site hostnames for local components
#            can also be used to define hostnames per environment under each environment section and have
#             service definition under 'All' to optimize the definitions
#     <variableName>:  command to be executed and output to be assigned this variable. Output can result in string or number
#               this names needs to be unique within a section. If the same name is present in 'All' also, 
#                values specified under environment section takes precedence
#     Note - predefined system variable names available for use are:
#             JASiteName - this will be defined automatically if 'SitePrefixLength' is defined in environment spec file
#             JAHostName  - this will be defined automatically all the time.
#   Items:
#     <itemName>: Unique name within this section
#               Suggest to use a name correlates to a process or application that uses this certificate
#               Suggested format <Component>.<subsystem>.test.<uniqueNameWithinTheSection>
#                   so that many reference files can be in the same Custom and Logs folders.
#       Command: run command to gather current state of the process like "ps -ef|grep <processName>" in Linux or
#             get-process -name <processName> in windows
#             to check whether a process is running before connecting to get the cert in use and decode it
#           Optional parameters, default None
#       Condition: '(>|<|=|!=|>=|<=)(space)(<number> or <string>)' 
#          If the output of above command results in multiple lines, count of lines is compared to the condition number.
#          If the output is single line and it is integer,
#              the output is converted to integer and compared with integer number specified in condition
#          Else output string is compared to the condition string.
#                This is useful to match the result of command like true, false, pass, fail etc to determin next step
#           Optional parameters, default None
#        ComparePatterns: optional parameter to check the presence of values in license output
#             Can be used to check for environment specific values in command output like license count, license end date etc
#             { 'regex pattern1': { groupX: valueX, groupY: valueY,...}, 'regex pattern2': { groupM: valueM, groupN: valueN,...} }
#             Group number is integer value starting with 1. Group 1 for first group matched, aligns with group numbers shown in regex101.com
#             Value can be number (integer, float) or string. Put string values within single quote ('') or double quote ("")
#             Recommand to use https://regex101.com/ to test the regex patterns, group numbers, values to ensure the spec is accurate
#             Value can also be variable name which can have different values for different environment.
#             variable needs to have single quote or doublequote before {{ and after }} so that YAML spec format is followed
#             Refer to examples to understand the usage possibilities.
#       Test: Command to run test, can be curl command to get/post data to web server, special tool to run a test. 
#             Need to make sure all those test commands are in allowed list (JAAllowCommands.Windows.conf)
#
#   Specify common certs under 'All' so that it applies to hosts in all environments.
#     Specify environment specific certs under Dev, Test, UAT, Prod... 
#     If an item with the same name and same name is specified under 'All', 
#       one specified under other environment takes precedence.
Dev:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: (LAPTOP-QOCNVF0T)
  Variable:
    WindowsLicense1: echo GMJN7
    WindowsLicense2: echo CGP29
    WindowsLicense3: echo WKP77
    WindowsLicense4: echo JPGMC
    WindowsLicense5: echo 9QBK4

  Items:
    ### these definitions override the definitions under 'All' section
    # Windows:
    #  License: wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey
Test:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: ((...)(t)(...)([0-9][0-9]))
UAT:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: ((...)(u)(...)([0-9][0-9]))
Prod:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: ((...)(p)(...)([0-9][0-9]))
#
# Keep definition for 'All' environment at the end.
# this is to ensure, Dev, Test, UAT, Prod etc environment specific values are seen/read first and 
# assigned to variables. If a variable is not yet defined under Dev, Test.. like environment,
# and that variable is defined under 'All', value under 'All' will be picked up
# if variable is already defined under environment before, value under 'All' will be ignored.
