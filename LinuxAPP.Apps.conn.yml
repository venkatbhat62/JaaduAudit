# connectivity test spec 
# Author: havembha@gmail.com,  2022-12-22
# Format
# <environment>: like Dev, Test, UAT, Prod... or All -  free form text
#   HostName: hostname in regular expression format. when current hostname match to this name, specification in section
#            override the spec in 'All' environment section
#   Variable: typically used to derive local site partial name to formulate local site hostnames for local components
#            can also be used to define hostnames per environment under each environment section and have
#             service definition under 'All' to optimize the definitions
#     <variableName>:  command to be executed and output to be assigned this variable. Output can result in string or number
#               this names needs to be unique within a section. If the same name is present in 'All' also, 
#                values specified under environment section takes precedence
#     Note - predefined system variable names available for use are:
#             JASiteName - this will be defined automatically if 'SitePrefixLength' is defined in environment spec file
#             JAHostName  - this will be defined automatically all the time.
#   Items:
#     <serviceName> - unique name identifying the service
#       Command: run command to gather current state of the process like "ps -ef|grep <processName>" in Linux or
#             get-process -name <processName> in windows
#             to check whether a process is running before doing connection check to listen port on local host
#           Optional parameters, default None
#       Condition: '(>|<|=|!=|>=|<=)(space)(<number> or <string>)' 
#          If the output of above command results in multiple lines, count of lines is compared to the condition number.
#          If the output is single line and it is integer,
#              the output is converted to integer and compared with integer number specified in condition
#          Else output string is compared to the condition string.
#                This is useful to match the result of command like true, false, pass, fail etc to determin next step
#           Optional parameters, default None
#       HostNames: destination hostname in short form or in FQDN form, can be IP address also. Can be single or in CSV format
#         destination hostname can be localhost, in which case the connectivity to local port is verified. 
#         This is be useful to check the local process listening in on expected LISTEN port
#         If more then one hostname is specified via CSV, connectivity check is performed for to all those hosts
#           for each of the ports specified under Ports.
#         can use variable names like '{{ var1 }}' or '{{ var2 }}<partialName>','{{ var2 }}<partialName>'
#             value of variable will be substitued to form full hostname
#             this format is similar to the one followed by ansible playbooks. 
#               need to use single quote or doube quote around {{ and }} so that those curly brackets are not interpretted as dictionary
#       Ports: single port or ports in CSV format, or port range like startingPort-(dash)-endingPort
#          if more than one port is specified or range is specified, connectivity is checked to all those ports
#            from current host to destination host
#       Protocol: TCP|UDP
#         If UDP, it will send UDP packets, so that one can check the receipt of packets on other end manually or using other tools
#           UDP does not provide any conclusive test results
#         Optional parameter, defaults to TCP
#
Dev:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: (LAPTOP-QOCNVF0T)
  Variable:
    ### these definitions override the definitions under 'All' section
    ### in DEV environment, connect to one remote host, in test environment, connect to diff host

  Items:
    ### these definitions override the definitions under 'All' section

  HostName: (...)(t)(...)([0-9][0-9])|(havembha)
  Variable:
    ### these definitions override the definitions under 'All' section
    ### in Test environment, connect to one remote host, in test environment, connect to diff host
    Var1: echo "google.com"
    ### below is to form test hostname after prefixing it with {{ JASiteName }} which will have first 3 letters of test hostname
    Var2: echo "embha"
    SMTPHostName: echo testhost
UAT:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: (...)(u)(...)([0-9][0-9])
  Variable:

Prod:
  # specify hostname in regular expression 
  HostName: (...)(p)(...)([0-9][0-9])
  Variable:
    SMTPHostName: echo testhost
#
# Keep definition for 'All' environment at the end.
# this is to ensure, Dev, Test, UAT, Prod etc environment specific values are seen/read first and 
# assigned to variables. If a variable is not yet defined under Dev, Test.. like environment,
# and that variable is defined under 'All', value under 'All' will be picked up
# if variable is already defined under environment before, value under 'All' will be ignored.

      HostNames: google.com,microsoft.com
      ### example of using port range
      Ports: 80-82
    VariableGoogle:
      HostNames: '{{ Var1 }}'

    VariableSiteName:
      ### use of multiple variables to formulate hostname
      ### JASiteName is system variable defined automatically when 'SitePrefixLength' is defined in environment spec file

      ### use of multiple variables to formulate hostname
      ### JAHostName is system variable defined automatically
      HostNames: '{{ JAHostName }}'

    SMTPService:
      ### here, service is defined in common section, SMTPHostName variable defined in environment specific section
      ###  so that connectivity test is done to diff hosts based on environment.
