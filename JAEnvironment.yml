### Parameter name needs to be unique across all sections - OS, Component, and Environment
### Parameters can be defined under OS, Component or Environment.
### Parameter value can be redefined in other sections to override previous value.
### Parameters under OS will be read first, under Component next and under Environment last.
### While reading parameters under Component, if a value is present under specific component, 
###   it will be stored as latest desired value, overriding the value previously defined under OS
### While reading parameters under Environment, if a value is present under specific environment, 
###   it will be stored as latest desired value, overriding the value previously defined under OS or Component
### In all cases (OS, Component, Environment sections), value under 'All' will be stored 
###   if the value is not yet stored before in any prior section.

Component:

  ###   <SubsystemName> - App for main application, DB for Database configurations, OS for OS configurations
  ###   <platform>  - keep this same as platform name defined before for this environment
  ###   <ComponentName> - abbreviated component name
  ###   [.<AppVersion>] - this application version will be appended run time to derive the config file to be used
  ###           based on current application release installed on that host.
  ###        Command specified under CommandToGetAppVersion will be used run time to derive the application version
  ###        If command is not specified under CommandToGetAppVersion, or version returned is TBD, 
  ###           AppVersion will not be appended to derive full name.
  ### Operations specific configuration file has operation name prefixed to above AppConfig file name
