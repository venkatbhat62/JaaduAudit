### Parameter name needs to be unique across all sections - OS, Component, and Environment
### Parameters can be defined under OS, Component or Environment.
### Parameter value can be redefined in other sections to override previous value.
### Parameters under OS will be read first, under Component next and under Environment last.
### While reading parameters under Component, if a value is present under specific component, 
###   it will be stored as latest desired value, overriding the value previously defined under OS
### While reading parameters under Environment, if a value is present under specific environment, 
###   it will be stored as latest desired value, overriding the value previously defined under OS or Component
### In all cases (OS, Component, Environment sections), value under 'All' will be stored 
###   if the value is not yet stored before in any prior section.

Component:
  ### using regular expression syntax, specify how to find component name of the application of platform
  ###  so that component specific variable values can be derived run time
  ### AppConfig naming convention - <platform><componentName>.<subsystemName>.<operation>[.<version>].yml where
  ###   <platform>  - keep this same as platform name defined before for this environment
  ###   <componentName> - abbreviated component name
  ###   <subsystemName> - Apps for main application, DB for Database configurations, OS for OS configurations
  ###   [.<version>] - this application version will be appended run time to derive the config file to be used
  ###           based on current application release installed on that host.
  ###        If the system is Apps, command specified under CommandToGetAppVersion will be used 
  ###           run time to derive the application version
  ###        For OS subsystem, command specified under CommandToGetOSVersion is used to derive the version
  ###        For DB subsystem, command specified under CommandToGetDBVersion is used to derive the version
  ###        This field is optional
  ###   <operation> - compare, conn, license, test, stats... 
  ###           each operation will have it's own spec file per platform, per component.
  ###           It is feasible to maintain that per subsystem also.
