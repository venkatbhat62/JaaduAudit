### Parameter name needs to be unique across all sections - OS, Component, and Environment
### Parameters can be defined under OS, Component or Environment.
### Parameter value can be redefined in other sections to override previous value defined in prior section(s).
### Parameters under OS will be read first, under Component next and under Environment last.
### While reading parameters under Component, if a value is present under specific component, 
###   it will be stored as latest desired value, overriding the value previously defined under OS
### While reading parameters under Environment, if a value is present under specific environment, 
###   it will be stored as latest desired value, overriding the value previously defined under OS or Component
### In all cases (OS, Component, Environment sections), value under 'All' will be stored 
###   if the value is not yet stored before in any prior section.

    LocalRepositoryHome: '$HOME/JaaduAudit'
    LogFilePath: '$HOME/JaaduAudit/Logs'
    ReportsPath: '$HOME/JaaduAudit/Reports'

Component:
  ### using regular expression syntax, specify how to find component name of the application of platform
  ###  so that component specific variable values can be derived run time
  ### AppConfig naming convention - <platform><componentName>.<subsystemName>.<operation>[.<version>].yml where
  ###   <platform>  - keep this same as platform name defined before for this environment
  ###   <componentName> - abbreviated component name
  ###   <subsystemName> - Apps for main application, DB for Database configurations, OS for OS configurations
  ###   [.<version>] - this application version will be appended run time to derive the config file to be used
  ###           based on current application release installed on that host.
  ###        If the system is Apps, command specified under CommandToGetAppVersion will be used 
  ###           run time to derive the application version
  ###        For OS subsystem, command specified under CommandToGetOSVersion is used to derive the version
  ###        For DB subsystem, command specified under CommandToGetDBVersion is used to derive the version
  ###        This field is optional
  ###   <operation> - compare, conn, license, test, stats... 
  ###           each operation will have it's own spec file per platform, per component.
  ###           It is feasible to maintain that per subsystem also.
  ###
  ### Examples:
  ###    Platform1APP.Apps.compare.yml, Platform1APP.OS.compare.yml, Platform1APP.DB.compare.yml
  ###    Platform1APP.Apps.compare.2.yml, Platform1APP.OS.compare.8.yml, Platform1APP.DB.compare.10.yml
  ###    Platform1APP.Apps.conn.yml, Platform1APP.OS.conn.yml, Platform1APP.DB.conn.yml
  ###
  ### Component spec is read when current hostname matches to the hostname regular expression defined under component name.
  ### Include only the component type used while defining the hostname, not any environment indicator used as part of the hostname
  ### Use wild card for site and environment portion of the hostname. If no such hostname convention exist, list all the
  ###   possible hostnames under all environments for that component type here so that the component spec applies to all hosts of 
  ###   that component type. 
  ### Use environment indicator like d or dv for DEV, t or st, i or it for test, ut, u for UAT, p or pd for production environment
  ###   in environment section so that variables can be defined that applies to all components in that environment.
  ### Specification under environment overrides the spec under component.

  ###  When current hostname match to the regular expression spec, all definitions under that environment will be used.
  ###  Spec under other environment without a regular expression match are ignored.
  ###
  ### Use environment indicator like d or dv for DEV, t or st, i or it for test, ut, u for UAT, p or pd for production environment
  ###   in environment section so that variables can be defined that applies to all components in that environment.
  ###
  ### It is possible to define the hostname regular expression in a broader way like one that applies to non-prod (all dev, system test
  ###   integration test or staging or pre-prod or uat) and another for prod (differest geographic locations or site groups) when
  ###   the variable spec needs to apply to that broader group.
  ### 
  ### Specification under environment overrides the spec under component and OS sections.

     ### local folders on target host where common and custom respositories from SCM are synced to.
     ###  these are sub-directories under JAAudit install path.
     ### If all code is kept on a single folder on SCM, put '' for below definitions so that

     ###   separate common code/scripts and customization files per component or per OS type
     LocalRepositoryCommon: Common
     LocalRepositoryCustom: Custom
     ### suggest to define this per OS type under OS section. If all components are similar for a given platform,
     ###   can define the common path below.
     ### root path on target host where the contents of Common and Custom files will be copied
     ###   where other sub-directories like Common.PrevVersion, Custom.PrevVersion, Reports, Logs are present

     ### default location to upload file on WebServer - local, replicate, support
     ###   local - file uploaded is kept on that web server only, not replicated to other WebServer, 
     ###       typically used to keep files of prod and non-prod seperate
     ###   replicate - replicate files to other WebServer or to WebServer in other environment like prod to non-prod
     ###         use replicate to place prod environment files to replicate areas so that users with non-prod access
     ###        can also access the prod environment files 
     ###   support - file uploaded is kept on that web server in a folder that can be accessed by support team
     ###       to download the file to user's host and process that file further 
     ###       support folder on webserver allows browsing capability and allows file download
